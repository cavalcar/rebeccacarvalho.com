    <h1>Rebecca Carvalho</h1>

    <p>Rebecca Carvalho is a Recifense writer based in Berkeley, California.
    She loves crafting stories filled with close-knit neighborhoods, Brazilian
    food, and telenovela-esque settings. When she is not writing, you can find
    her with her camera, gaming with her husband, or watching Star Trek for the
    hundredth time. Rebecca has a bachelorâ€™s degree in English from Lawrence
    University. Salt and Sugar is her debut novel, and it was inspired by her
    life in northeastern Brazil.</p>

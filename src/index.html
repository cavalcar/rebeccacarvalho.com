    <h1>SALT AND SUGAR</h1>
    <p class="out-now">Out now!</p>

    <p>The grandchildren of two rival Brazilian bakeries fall in love despite their
    families’ feud in this delicious debut rom-com perfect for fans of Nicola Yoon
    and Gloria Chao.</p>

    <p>Trust neither thin-bottomed frying pans nor Molinas.</p>

    <p>Lari Ramires has always known this to be true. In Olinda, Brazil, her
    family’s bakery, Salt, has been at war with the Molinas’ bakery across the
    street, Sugar, for generations. But Lari’s world turns upside down when her
    beloved grandmother passes away. On top of that, a big supermarket chain has
    moved to town, forcing many of the small businesses to close.</p>

    <p>Determined to protect her home, Lari does the unthinkable—she works together
    with Pedro Molina to save both of their bakeries. Lari realizes she might not
    know Pedro as well as she thought—and she maybe even likes what she learns—but
    the question remains: Can a Ramires and a Molina truly trust one another?</p>
